# WORKFORCE360

WORKFORCE360 is a machine learning model designed to predict employee attrition in order to help companies retain valuable employees and reduce costs associated with turnover. Our three-tier solution includes resume parsing, predictive analytics, and performance prediction to provide a comprehensive HR solution that helps companies make informed decisions about recruitment and employee retention.

## Features

Our model offers the following features:

- Resume Parsing: Automatically extract key information from resumes such as name, contact information, work experience, education, and skills.
- Predictive Analytics: Predict the likelihood of an employee leaving based on various factors such as job satisfaction, salary, benefits, and work-life balance.
- Performance Prediction: Predict the future performance of employees based on their past performance and other factors.

## Getting Started

To use our model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run `python resume_parser.py` to parse the resumes and store the information in a database.
3. Run `python predictive_analytics.py` to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving based on the information stored in the database.
4. Run `python performance_prediction.py` to predict the future performance of employees based on their past performance and other factors.
