# WORKFORCE360

WORKFORCE360 is a machine learning model designed to predict employee attrition in order to help companies retain valuable employees and reduce costs associated with turnover. Our three-tier solution includes resume parsing, predictive analytics, and performance prediction to provide a comprehensive HR solution that helps companies make informed decisions about recruitment and employee retention.
## Problem Statement

The problem at hand is employee attrition, which is a significant concern for businesses due to its costs associated with rehiring, retraining, loss of productivity, and workflow disruptions. The firm has collected employee performance data for a select number of months, randomly chosen for each employee. They intend to analyze this data to identify specific features that are highly indicative of attrition. This will provide insights into the reasons why employees leave and help the company take appropriate actions to mitigate such issues.


## Solution

To achieve this, the consulting firm will leverage machine learning algorithms that can analyze patterns in the collected data. The model will use the identified features to predict whether an employee is likely to quit soon. By doing so, the company can intervene to retain the employee, thereby reducing attrition rates.

# Employee Attrition Prediction

Price and Waters, a data science consulting firm, aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an employee will likely leave the company soon. This model will enable them to take pre-emptive measures to address the underlying issues faced by the employee and minimize the likelihood of attrition.



Overall, the solution entails building a predictive model that can identify employees who are likely to leave, discover the features that drive attrition, and take appropriate measures to mitigate them. The insights gained from this exercise will enable the company to reduce attrition rates and minimize the costs associated with employee turnover.

# What’s OneAPI AI Toolkit

Resources

Want to reduce your model training and inference time but can’t afford expensive GPUs? Looking for ways to accelerate your end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines on various intel architectures? Fret not, Intel’s oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) provides intel XPU’s based optimizations for popular tools such as Python, Pandas (Modin), scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and PyTorch. This toolkit is based on the OneAPI programming model. Wait, what’s OneAPI?

What’s OneAPI?​
OneAPI is a cross-architecture language based on C++ and SYCL standards. It provides powerful libraries designed for an acceleration of domain-specified functions. The bold vision of OneAPI is to have a cross-architecture, cross vendors' software portability while providing you with all the performance your need. So no matter what devices and accelerators your system might have or what languages and libraries each of these devices are using, middleware or frameworks applications and workloads, OneAPI is bridging, abstracting and bringing all these devices to a common ground.

The industry-wide spec of OneAPI defines a low-level abstraction layer inside the software stack and you can use the set of optimized libraries for various domains. for example, oneDNN the deep neural network library or oneMKL, the Math Kernal Library and more. In addition, for cross-architecture direct programming the Data Parallel C++ or DPC++ language is included. It is built on open standards and specifications. The Intel implementation of OneAPI includes many additional libraries, compilers, and analyzers. It is arranged in toolkits for specific application domains and can be downloaded in many ways or used remotely on the Intel DevCloud.

Think of it as a programming model that brings many languages, libraries, and hardware to a common ground where memory spaces could be shared, code could be ported, re-used and tools could work across architectures.

Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit)​
Intel AI Analytics Toolkit contains tools and frameworks to accelerate end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines on Intel® architectures. It is built using OneAPI libraries for compute optimizations.

Using this toolkit, you can:

Deliver high-performance, deep-learning training on Intel® XPUs and integrate fast inference into your AI development workflow with Intel®-optimized, deep-learning frameworks for TensorFlow* and PyTorch*, pre-trained models, and low-precision tools.

Achieve drop-in acceleration for data preprocessing and machine-learning workflows with compute-intensive Python* packages, Modin*, scikit-learn*, and XGBoost, optimized for Intel.

Gain direct access to analytics and AI optimizations from Intel to ensure that your software works together seamlessly.



## Features

Our model offers the following features:

- Resume Parsing: Automatically extract key information from resumes such as name, contact information, work experience, education, and skills.
- Predictive Analytics: Predict the likelihood of an employee leaving based on various factors such as job satisfaction, salary, benefits, and work-life balance.
- Performance Prediction: Predict the future performance of employees based on their past performance and other factors.

## Getting Started

To use our model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. git clone 'https://github.com/Ahamedthaiyub/Workfoce360'.
3. git-init to initialize git.
