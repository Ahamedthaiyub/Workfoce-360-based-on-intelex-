It is a machine learning model associated with Intel One API. It is designed to predict employee attrition, which can help companies retain valuable employees and reduce costs associated with turnover. Our three-tier solutions includes resume parsing, predictive analytics, and performance prediction, providing a comprehensive HR solution that helps companies make informed decisions about recruitment and employee retention.

## Problem Statement

The problem at hand is employee attrition, which is a significant concern for businesses due to its costs associated with rehiring, retraining, loss of productivity, and workflow disruptions. The firm has collected employee performance data for a select number of months, randomly chosen for each employee. They intend to analyze this data to identify specific features that are highly indicative of attrition. This will provide insights into the reasons why employees leave and help the company take appropriate actions to mitigate such issues.


## Solution 
To achieve this, the consulting firm will leverage machine learning algorithms that can analyze patterns in the collected data. The model will use the identified features to predict whether an employee is likely to quit soon. By doing so, the company can intervene to retain the employee, thereby reducing attrition rates.

# story of the model-

 A data science consulting firm, aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether an employee will likely leave the company soon. This model will enable them to take pre-emptive measures to address the underlying issues faced by the employee and minimize the likelihood of attrition.



Overall, the solution entails building a predictive model that can identify employees who are likely to leave, discover the features that drive attrition, and take appropriate measures to mitigate them. The insights gained from this exercise will enable the company to reduce attrition rates and minimize the costs associated with employee turnover.

# Letâ€™s learn Intel oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkitâ€‹
# Introduction:

One of the main challenges in machine learning is optimizing the code for better performance. This is where Intel One API comes in. Intel One API provides a unified and simplified programming model for accelerating the execution of high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and internet of things (IoT) workloads. By using Intel One API, we can optimize the performance of the Workforce 360 model, making it faster and more efficient.



## Features-

Our model offers the following features:

- Resume Parsing: Automatically extract key information from resumes such as name, contact information, work experience, education, and skills.
- Predictive Analytics: Predict the likelihood of an employee leaving based on various factors such as job satisfaction, salary, benefits, and work-life balance.
- Performance Prediction: Predict the future performance of employees based on their past performance and other factors.

## Getting Started-

To use our model, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. git clone 'https://github.com/Ahamedthaiyub/Workfoce360'.
3. git-init to initialize git.

## Currently-
"We are creating a website showcasing our data-driven solutions, and we have a demo using the dataset from xxxx company in 2012, which is included in our GitHub files. Our website is currently only available for the medical industry, specifically for our Doctor-Opportunities (Doc-opp) platform. For optimizing our model, we utilized the Intelex extension. However, this model is not yet ready for publication, so we cannot provide any GitHub resources at this time. This decision was made by myself, Ahamed Thaiyub A, and myÂ internÂ team."

## Note -
It's important that github does'nt supports cufflinks and poltly, So visuals are not there in  Tire 3. So if you wish to see it kindly clone the git files.
